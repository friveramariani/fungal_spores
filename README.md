# Fungal Spores in the Caribbean Basin

Fungal spores are an important biological airborne particulate worldwide, including in the Caribbean basin. Fungal spores are also a known potential inducer of episodes of allergic respiratory diseases, such as asthma and allergic rhinitis. Nevertheless, most studies have been performed in temperate regions. Less is known in the Caribbean basin. This repository contain website files for a multidisciplinary collaborations between scientists located in Spain, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the United States to provide further insights role of airborne fungal spores in the Caribbean basin. 

Among the collaborators from this study are:
